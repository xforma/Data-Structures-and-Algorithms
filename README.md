# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
<h2> Purpose</h2>
To provide theoretical knowledge of information gathering, processing and sharing in communication systems, and of their structure, behaviour and mutual interaction.
Outcome of this course should be the skills of design and implementation of various forms of abstract data types and its application to solve specific problems. To solve them, linear, tree and graph data structures can be used, furthemore searching in the data structures and used genetic algorithms for search in a search space and optimization.
